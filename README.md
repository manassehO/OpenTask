## What is OpenTask?

OpenTask is an open-source platform designed to streamline micro-task management
for development teams using blockchain technology. Built on Starknet's Layer 2
solution, it enables:

- **Create tasks**: Post small jobs (e.g., bug fixes, code reviews,
  documentation) with transparent rewards in cryptocurrency.
- **Complete tasks**: Submit work and receive instant payment via secure smart
  contracts.
- **Track tasks**: Monitor progress through a clean, intuitive dashboard.

By leveraging blockchain technology, OpenTask eliminates payment friction,
ensures transparent work agreements, and creates an efficient marketplace for
development tasksâ€”whether you're managing an open-source project or coordinating
development work across teams.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- Rust (for Cairo tooling)
- Starknet wallet (Argent X or Braavos)
- STRK testnet tokens (via Starknet faucet)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/opentask.git
   cd opentask
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

### Smart Contract Setup

1. Install Cairo tooling:
   ```bash
   curl -L https://get.starknet.io | sh
   # Follow prompts to install Scarb and other tools
   ```

2. Compile the smart contract:
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   scarb build
   ```

3. Deploy to testnet (requires testnet tokens):
   ```bash
   starknet-deploy --network testnet ./target/OpenTask.json
   ```

## Usage

### Creating a Task

1. Connect your Starknet wallet by clicking "Connect Wallet" in the top right
2. Navigate to "Create Task" and fill in:
   - Task title and description
   - Reward amount in STRK
   - Deadline (optional)
3. Submit the task, which will require a wallet confirmation
4. Your task will appear in the task list once confirmed on the blockchain

### Completing a Task

1. Browse available tasks on the dashboard
2. Select a task and click "Accept"
3. Complete the work according to the task description
4. Submit your work with proof (link, description, etc.)
5. Once approved by the task creator, payment is automatically released to your
   wallet

### Managing Tasks

- Use the dashboard to view tasks you've created or accepted
- Filter by status (open, in progress, completed)
- Approve submissions for tasks you've created

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Frontend tests
npm test

# Smart contract tests
cd contracts
scarb test
```

### Building for Production

```bash
